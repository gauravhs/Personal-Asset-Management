# Personal-Asset-Management
Abstract - Finance is an integral part of everyone’s life and financial principles are based on pure and simple common sense. For one’s financial well-being, management of personal finances is very much essential. Money management aims to give the power and the knowledge to take control of the money. Keeping track of personal expenses, personal debt and savings helps in calculation of net worth. Personal Finance for the mass has for long been ignored by many investment banks. Moreover, the Banking strategies used by investment banks are very expensive as they require individual portfolio managers which can’t be afforded by a common man. Hence, we’re automating the process of investing by creating an investment software application. This application can be used as a one stop shop for maintaining a user’s personal finances. It eliminates intervention by humans on the Bank’s side and is a direct link between financial instruments and the person. The Key highlight is creating our proprietary Risk Return Index for the calculations and calibration.
